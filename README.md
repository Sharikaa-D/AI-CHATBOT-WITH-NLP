ABOUT THE PROJECT:

🤖 AI Chatbot Using NLP (NLTK)

A simple AI chatbot coded using **Python** and **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** that accepts user input with the help of basic **Natural Language Processing** and returns answers to a fixed set of queries. The project was developed as a part of an internship task.

 📚 How It Works

1. User input is passed through the following NLP preprocessing steps:
   - Case conversion: lower case
   - Tokenization
   - Removal of stopwords and punctuation
   - Lemmatization
2. The preprocessed input is matched with a **predefined knowledge base**
3. If a fuzzy match is established, the pertinent response is given
4. If fuzzy matching fails, a default message is communicated

🚀 How to Use

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**
2. Run every cell in the notebook
3. Type your messages in the textbox and press **Enter**.
4. Now, start conversing with your bot! 🎉
